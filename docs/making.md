# Making this site
{{ head() }}
This is my first website which may be 'quite useful'.
I've always taken lots of time configuring as if I were working on such a huge
project.

So I forgave and used MkDocs. (and Material for MkDocs).
I wanted to make something instantly and showed me it as soon as.

The reason I made this:

- some portfolio?
- to remember; I may forget all of this without writing down
- contributing to public goods(?)

If you want a professional, precise document, you may leave this website.
I'm just a student in Korea; poor at English, develop for fun.
